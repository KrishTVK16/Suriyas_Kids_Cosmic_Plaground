He visited a school where children were learning about friendship and kindness. Zorp watched as kids helped each other with their homework and shared their snacks. He learned that Earth is special because people care for each other. By the end of his visit, Zorp had made many new friends and promised to come back to Earth again. He realized that friendship is the most important thing in the universe!",

They're my favorite animal now!\n\nSilver laughter in the sea,\nDolphins dance where waves run free.\nMoonlight hums their secret song,\nJoy swims softly all day long.\n\nThrough the ocean blue and deep,\nThey play and leap while others sleep.\nFriends forever, side by side,\nIn the water, they will glide.",
